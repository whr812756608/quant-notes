OLS with y ~ x1 + x2, the goodness of fit is very good, but the significance for the regression coefficient of both x1 and x2 are not good. What could be the cause and how to deal with it? (Pont72)
OLS with y ~ x, how does high autocorrelation affect the coefficients for x and how does it affect the t statistics? (Point72)
